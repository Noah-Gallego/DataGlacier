# Data Glacier Internship (First Six Weeks)
This is a remote data science internship where I got hands-on experience with exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and validation, machine learning, and model deployment to the cloud. 
These weeks represent individual work for the first half of the internship.

The final group project (Week 7 - Week 13) is represented in a shared repository. During these seven weeks, I worked as a team further exploring data analysis, machine learning, and various technologies.
